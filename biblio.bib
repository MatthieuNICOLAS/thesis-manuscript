  abstract = {Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes can simplify the design of predictable eventual consistency. They can be classified into state-based or operation-based. Operation-based approaches have the potential for allowing compact designs in both the sent message and the object state size, but current approaches are still far from this objective. Here we explore the design space for operation-based solutions, and we leverage the interaction with the middleware by offering a technique that delivers very compact solutions, while only broadcasting operation names and arguments.},

  abstract = {Programming geo-replicated distributed systems is challenging given the complexity of reasoning about different evolving states on different replicas. Existing approaches to this problem impose significant burden on application developers to consider the effect of how operations performed on one replica are witnessed and applied on others. To alleviate these challenges, we present a fundamentally different approach to programming in the presence of replicated state. Our insight is based on the use of invertible relational specifications of an inductively-defined data type as a mechanism to capture salient aspects of the data type relevant to how its different instances can be safely merged in a replicated environment. Importantly, because these specifications only address a data type's (static) structural properties, their formulation does not require exposing low-level system-level details concerning asynchrony, replication, visibility, etc. As a consequence, our framework enables the correct-by-construction synthesis of rich merge functions over arbitrarily complex (i.e., composable) data types. We show that the use of a rich relational specification language allows us to extract sufficient conditions to automatically derive merge functions that have meaningful non-trivial convergence properties. We incorporate these ideas in a tool called Quark, and demonstrate its utility via a detailed evaluation study on real-world benchmarks.},

Existing general-purpose set CRDTs associate every element in the set with causal contexts as meta data. Manipulation of causal contexts can be complicated and costly. We present a new set CRDT, CLSet (causal-length set), where the meta data associated with an element is simply a natural number (called causal length). We compare CLSet with existing general purpose CRDTs in terms of semantics and performance.},

  abstract = {Collaborative text editors allow two or more users to concurrently edit a shared document without merge conflicts. Such systems require an algorithm to provide convergence, ensuring all clients that have seen the same set of document edits are in the same state. Unfortunately convergence alone does not guarantee that a collaborative text editor is usable. Several published algorithms for collaborative text editing exhibit an undesirable anomaly in which concurrently inserted portions of text with a well-defined order may be randomly interleaved on a character-by-character basis, resulting in an unreadable jumble of letters. Although this anomaly appears to be known informally by some researchers in the field, we are not aware of any published work that fully explains or addresses it. We show that several algorithms suffer from this problem, explain its cause, and also identify a lesser variant of the anomaly that occurs in another algorithm. Moreover, we propose a specification of collaborative text editing that rules out the anomaly, and show how to prevent the lesser anomaly from occurring in one particular algorithm.},

  abstract = {Real-time group editing has been envisioned as an important application for group collaboration. Operational transformation (OT) has been the concurrency control mechanism for group editing, due to its potential for high responsiveness to local editing operations. OT algorithms are generally very sophisticated and computation intensive. Recently, commutative replicated data types (CRDT) have appeared as viable substitutes of OT. Existing OT and CRDT work suffers from serious limitations. This note presents a CRDT that addresses some of these limitations.},

  Causal Tree model. Past models of this kind either retrofitted local linear orders
  to a distributed system (the OT approach) or employed distributed data models locally
  (the CRDT approach). That caused either extreme fragility in a distributed setting
  or egregious overheads in local use. Overall, that local/distributed impedance mismatch
  is cognitively taxing and causes lots of complexity. We solve that by using subjective
  linear orders locally at each replica, while inter-replica communication uses a distributed
  model. A separate translation layer insulates local data structures from the distributed
  environment. We modify the Lamport timestamping scheme to make that translation as
  trivial as possible. We believe our approach has applications beyond the domain of
  collaborative editing.},

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a family of data types specially designed for highly available systems which guarantee some form of eventual consistency. However, memory usage may grow unboundedly in their implementations, as garbage collection of meta-data is not tackled in most approaches.  In this paper, we explore a memory management model for operation-based CRDTs in dynamic setting, where nodes can dynamically join a network, and where the implementation can remove unnecessary meta-data employed by CRDTs used to determine the order of operations applied in different replicas. We first describe how new nodes will be brought up-to-date and fully linked with other replicas, and later we introduce our memory management model which allows meta-data to be removed.  We benchmark the memory usage of an add-wins set using different garbage collection techniques in various situations and show how our approach can be beneficial in comparison to state of the art techniques.},

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are a family of data types specially designed for highly available systems which guarantee some form of eventual consistency. In this paper, we show that the reliance on reliable causal broadcasting (RCB) middleware by existing CRDT frameworks may lead to less reactive CRDTs which in turn hampers user experience. We propose a solution that improves the reactivity of CRDTs built on an RCB middleware by reifying buffered operations. We apply our strategy to the pure operation-based CRDT framework, allowing for reactive pure operation-based CRDTs. We describe our approach as a formal extension to the framework and implement it in Flec, an extensible and open CRDT framework. The extension is then used to create new Add-Wins and Remove-Wins sets which exhibit higher reactivity.},

  abstract="In cloud computing environments, data storage systems often rely on optimistic replication to provide good performance and availability even in the presence of failures or network partitions. In this scenario, it is important to be able to accurately and efficiently identify updates executed concurrently. Current approaches to causality tracking in optimistic replication have problems with concurrent updates: they either (1) do not scale, as they require replicas to maintain information that grows linearly with the number of writes or unique clients; (2) lose information about causality, either by removing entries from client-id based version vectors or using server-id based version vectors, which cause false conflicts. We propose a new logical clock mechanism and a logical clock framework that together support a traditional key-value store API, while capturing causality in an accurate and scalable way, avoiding false conflicts. It maintains concise information per data replica, only linear on the number of replica servers, and allows data replicas to be compared and merged linear with the number of replica servers and versions.",

Accounting for and understanding the implications of network behavior is key to designing robust distributed programs; in fact, six of Deutsch’s "fallacies" directly pertain to limitations on networked communications. This should be unsurprising: the ability (and often requirement) to communicate over a shared channel is a defining characteristic of distributed programs, and many of the key results in the field pertain to the possibility and impossibility of performing distributed computations under particular sets of network conditions.},

  abstract = {Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) enable two or more people, separated in the real world, to share the same virtual “space.” They can be used for many purposes, from teleconferencing to training people to perform assembly tasks. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of CVEs is compromised by one major problem: the delay that exists in the networks linking users together. Whilst we have a good understanding, especially in the visual modality, of how users are affected by delayed feedback from their own actions, little research has systematically examined how users are affected by delayed feedback from other people, particularly in environments that support haptic (force) feedback. The current study addresses this issue by quantifying how increasing levels of latency affect visual and haptic feedback in a collaborative target acquisition task. Our results demonstrate that haptic feedback in particular is very sensitive to low levels of delay. Whilst latency affects visual feedback from 50 ms, it impacts on haptic task performance 25 ms earlier, and causes the haptic measures of performance deterioration to rise far more steeply than visual. The “impact-perceive-adapt” model of user performance, which considers the interaction between performance measures, perception of latency, and the breakdown of perception of immediate causality, is proposed as an explanation for the observed pattern of performance.},

  abstract = {Distributed file systems have become an essential service for sharing data among users. An important aspect of a file system is its ability to keep its contents secure from unauthorized access. To investigate the interplay of security and consistency in distributed file systems, we formalize the three properties related to data security, namely confidentiality, integrity and accessibility. Based on these properties, we provide an impossibility result that indicates that these properties cannot be achieved together in a highly-available partition-tolerant setting. We further discuss a CRDT-based model, implementing the traditional POSIX access control policy, that guarantees confidentiality and integrity while precluding accessibility only in rare situations. Our conclusion is that the POSIX policies are not suitable in a distributed system setting, but that a more fine-grained model is required to obtain the security semantics that reflect the users' intention.},

  abstract = {Distributed applications are part of our everyday lives, but too often their good operation depends on central servers, all potential points of failure and performance bottlenecks. Designing systems for fully distributed communications however still requires porting common mechanisms needed for feature-rich modern applications such as user rights differentiation, multiple administrators, and end-to-end encryption. We propose a distributed access control mechanism for collaborative applications by relying on conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT), and design an access control policy CRDT able to support Google Docs and POSIX file systems as example of distributed applications. To enforce that policy, we outline a generic data model, examine different conflict resolution strategies at the data and policy levels, and consider a novel approach towards conflicts between data and policy operations.},

abstract = {Schema evolution is a pervasive challenge in distributed systems. Developers often resort to ad hoc solutions that mix compatibility concerns with application code. We propose a principled replacement: an isolated software layer that uses bidirectional lenses to translate data between schemas on demand to maintain backward and forward compatibility.We have implemented these ideas in a TypeScript library called Cambria, and integrated it with the Automerge CRDT to support peer-to-peer editing. We share reflections from building a decentralized issue tracker application and successfully using Cambria to maintain compatibility across versions. We also present our vision for a "Cambrian Era" for software, where better schema evolution tools enable people to customize their software more freely while preserving the ability to collaborate.},

A certain number of interactions is needed but the overall cost is low. There is a complexity tradeoff. Depending on the network used, we either have a constant (in the number of conference participants) number of rounds (exchanges) or a constant communication and computation overhead. Our technique for authentication can be extended and used as the basis for an authentication scheme which is `proven' secure against any type of attack, provided the Discrete Logarithm problem is intractable.",

  abstract = {Causal message ordering is required for several distributed applications. In order to preserve causal ordering, only direct dependency information between messages, with respect to the destination process(es), need be sent with each message. By eliminating other kinds of control information from the messages, the communication overheads can be significantly reduced. In this paper we present an algorithm that uses this knowledge to efficiently enforce causal ordering of messages. The proposed algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the network topology or communication pattern. As computation proceeds, it acquires knowledge of the communication pattern and is capable of handling dynamically changing multicast communication groups, and minimizing the communication overheads. With regard to communication overheads, the algorithm is optimal for the broadcast communication case. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the algorithm imposes lower communication overheads than previous causal ordering algorithms. The algorithm can be employed in a variety of distributed computing environments. Its energy efficiency and low bandwidth requirement make it especially suitable for mobile computing systems. We show how to employ the algorithm for causally ordered multicasting of messages in mobile computing environments.}

Its generalized and practical implementations in terms of partially ordered logical clocks are described. Such clocks can provide a decentralized definition of time for distributed computing systems, which lack a common time base. In their full generality, partially ordered logical clocks may be impractically expensive for long-lived computations. Several possible optimizations, depending on the application environment in which the clocks will be used, are described. Some applications are summarized.},
